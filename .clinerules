- This project is managed by `pdm`. Do not invoke Python or its packages/tools directly.
- You may read `pyproject.toml` to understand it better and know the available scripts.
- Target the Python 3.10 language level but don't use currently deprecated/removed syntax.
- Always use correct type hints.
- Always write a Google-style docstring, without types since we have proper type hints.
- All comments should focus on "why" rather than "what". Comment only where not obvious.
- Never create doc/markdown files unless specifically instructed.
- Keep human readability and maintainability in mind when designing a solution or refactoring.
- Everything must fully adhere to SOLID principles.
- Implement everything, don't leave TODO comments or missing parts.
- Understand your task, don't make guesses, stop and ask questions if anything is unclear.
