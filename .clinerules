- This project is managed by `pdm`. Do not invoke Python or its packages/tools directly.
- You may read `pyproject.toml` to understand it better and know the available scripts.
- Target the Python 3.10 language level but don't use currently deprecated/removed syntax.
- Prioritize working code first, then quality, then meaningful must-have tests last.
- Always use correct type hints.
- Always write a Google-style docstring, without types since we have proper type hints.
- All comments should focus on "why" rather than "what". Comment only where not obvious.
- Never create doc/markdown files unless specifically instructed.
- Keep human readability and maintainability in mind when designing a solution or refactoring.
- Apply SOLID principles pragmatically, don't over-abstract for future flexibility.
- Implement everything, don't leave TODO comments or missing parts.
- Understand your task, don't make guesses, stop and ask questions if anything is unclear.
- Any test must be unique in purpose.
- Method arguments should be unique in purpose and not contain information other ones do.
- Use relative imports within a package.
- DRY is a very high priority, refactor things that exist in multiple places.
- Unused/unreachable objects should be removed.
- Imports belong at the top of the file.
- Code is a liability, do not over-engineer.
- For error handling, be explicit about what exceptions can be raised.
- Prefer composition over inheritance where reasonable.
- Use descriptive variable names, avoid abbreviations unless domain-standard.
